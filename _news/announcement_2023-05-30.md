I will be serving as a text analysis consultant for the [Cornell University Summer Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities](https://digitalscholarship.library.cornell.edu/summer-dh) this summer! I will be working with three fellows studying Sanskrit Philosophical texts, English economics texts, and Spanish poetry!
