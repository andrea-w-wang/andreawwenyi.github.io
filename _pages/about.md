I am a first-year PhD student in [Information Science at Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I am advised by [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [David Mimno](http://www.mimno.org/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Computational Social Science. 

My works often involve understanding the characteristics of computational text analysis tools, such as topic modeling and multilingual large language models. Specifically, I aim to study how these tools could meet the needs of humanists/social scientists with text data. So far, I have worked on projects involving criminal justice, gender studies, and misinformation. 

Prior to joining Cornell, I worked as a data scientist at New York University's Public Safety Lab, with [Anna Harvey](https://wp.nyu.edu/annaharvey/) and Orion Taylor, on [Jail Data Initiative](https://publicsafetylab.org/jail-data-initiative). I participated in [g0v](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/), a grassroot civic-tech community in Taiwan, where I was one of the main contributors of [0archive](https://0archive.tw/) project. 
          
I held a Bachelor in Finance from National Taiwan University and a M.S. from [NYU's Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), where I learned to appreciate the beauty of math and algorithms.  

If you’re looking for advice on applying to PhD programs, I’m happy to chat and offer my experiences. Send me an email at aww66[at]cornell.edu!
