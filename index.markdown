## About me
I am currently a first-year PhD student in [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Cornell University, where I am advised by [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [David Mimno](http://www.mimno.org/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science, and Algorithmic effects. 

Specifically, I am interested in studying the effect of language technologies in multicultural and multilingual contexts. Parallel, I am keen on developing computational and text-mining methodology for social science research that are robust and reproducible.

Prior to joining Cornell, I worked as a data scientist at New York University's Public Safety Lab, with [Anna Harvey](https://wp.nyu.edu/annaharvey/) and Orion Taylor, on [Jail Data Initiative](https://publicsafetylab.org/jail-data-initiative). I participated in [g0v](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/), a grassroot civic-tech community in Taiwan, where I was one of the main contributors of [0archive](https://0archive.tw/) project. 
          
I received my M.S. degree from [NYU's Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), where I learned to appreciate the beauty of math and algorithms.
